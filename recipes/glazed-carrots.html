    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Glazed Carrots coated in a mixture of brown sugar and butter are a versatile side dish you can serve alongside a weeknight meatloaf, a Sunday ham, or your Thanksgiving turkey. These caramelized carrots are a definite kid-pleaser but they're elegant enough to impress the adults as well!
    </p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Carrots: Look for firm, plump, bright, and smooth carrots.</li>
        <li>Butter: You'll need about Â¼ cup butter to make these caramelized carrots.</li>
        <li>Brown sugar: You can use light or dark brown sugar.</li>
        <li>Seasonings: These Glazed Carrots are simply seasoned with salt and ground white pepper.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Cook the carrots: Place the peeled and cut carrots in a saucepan, cover with water, and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat and simmer until the carrots are tender. Drain.</li>
        <li>Glaze the carrots: Melt the butter in a saucepan, then add the sugar, salt, and pepper. Add carrots and toss until well-coated.</li>
        <li>Allow the Glazed Carrots to cool completely, then transfer to an airtight container. Store your leftovers in the refrigerator for up to four days. Reheat in the microwave or on the stove. We don't recommend freezing these Glazed Carrots, as the texture will become mushy during the thawing process.</li>
    </ol>
